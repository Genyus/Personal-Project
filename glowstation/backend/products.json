It’s good for those with ageing concerns, as its star ingredient - CoQ-10 - works to boost the skin’s natural repair and defence mechanisms for a smoother complexion over time. It also contains hyaluronic acid (an impressive humectant), which works to help the skin retain much-needed moisture, while soothing aloe vera, chamomile and cucumber keep skin calm and contented. Think of this as a skin-softening precursor to your serum or moisturiser."

In synergy with a 2% concentration amino acid-based humectant, the formula is supercharged with Snow Mushroom (or Tremella Fuciformis), a jelly-like fungus that has been used in Chinese medicines and skincare for millennia. Its gelatinous structure, combined with high levels of polysaccharide molecules, act similarly to Hyaluronic acid, by binding moisture to the skin, but has the capacity to penetrate even deeper thanks to its smaller molecular structure. Enriched with Madecassoside, an active ingredient derived from the Centella Asiatica plant, offers anti-itching and anti-irritation powers to calm redness and sensitivities."

            "smallDes": "Super lightweight water-based formula that instantly hydrates your skin with a subtle floral rose scent. Smooth over your face and body for soft, moisturized skin.",
            "largeDes": "Uniting hydroessential rose, with the brand’s signature Vor-Mag water and glycerin, this calming and hydrating mist is incredibly versatile – not to mention incredibly clean. The glycerin acts as a humectant – attracting and retaining water in a bid to supplement cells’ reservoirs – while the Vor-mag water (meaning that the water has been magnetised and ‘vortexed’ to increase its energy and vibration) works in tandem with the healing and mood-elevating rosewater to leave skin feeling supple, soft and ‘springy’. Simply mist over face, hair and scalp to hydrate and rebalance whenever you start to feel fraught."
