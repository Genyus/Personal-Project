It’s good for those with ageing concerns, as its star ingredient - CoQ-10 - works to boost the skin’s natural repair and defence mechanisms for a smoother complexion over time. It also contains hyaluronic acid (an impressive humectant), which works to help the skin retain much-needed moisture, while soothing aloe vera, chamomile and cucumber keep skin calm and contented. Think of this as a skin-softening precursor to your serum or moisturiser."

In synergy with a 2% concentration amino acid-based humectant, the formula is supercharged with Snow Mushroom (or Tremella Fuciformis), a jelly-like fungus that has been used in Chinese medicines and skincare for millennia. Its gelatinous structure, combined with high levels of polysaccharide molecules, act similarly to Hyaluronic acid, by binding moisture to the skin, but has the capacity to penetrate even deeper thanks to its smaller molecular structure. Enriched with Madecassoside, an active ingredient derived from the Centella Asiatica plant, offers anti-itching and anti-irritation powers to calm redness and sensitivities."
