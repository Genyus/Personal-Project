# Personal-Project

Introduction to my personal project for the Black Codher Bootcamp.

Glow Station is a skincare E-commerce store with a focus on skin-education. The main feature is the 'Routine Builder', which allows users to answer questions based on their skin type, and the Routine Builder will generate a custom, personalised skincare routine for them to use based off their answers. After recieving their results, users can either add those items directly to cart and checkout, or they can naviagte to the 'Shop' section for more product selection.

To run the project, in your terminal :

```
cd glowstation

npm install

cd backend

npm install
```
then in glowstation,
```
npm start
```

Package informaton details about node package managers are detailed inside the glow station directory.
