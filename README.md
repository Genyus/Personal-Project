# Personal-Project

Introduction to my personal project for the Black Codher Bootcamp.

Glow Station is a skincare E-commerce store with a focus on skin-education. It aims to make skincare 'simple' and easy for all, regardless of gender or skin tone.
The main feature is the 'Routine Builder', a personalised skin assessment which allows the user to answer questions directly relating to skin. Based on the combination of answers selected, the the Routine Builder will return an easy-to-follow skincare routine for them, that can be used Morning & Night.

After recieving their results, users can either add those items directly to cart and checkout via Paypal, or they can navigate to the 'Shop' section for more selection and browsing.

Other features of this project include:
- Personalised user expierence, remembering and using the user's inputted name throughout the site.
- Search bar functionality 
- Shop page, with ability to add/remove products to a wishlist
- Two different types of product filtering - Filter & refine through the shop sidebar or through the suggested product graphics 
- Routine Builder
- Ability to recieve discounted price on products via a discount code
- Checkout with PayPal
- A 'Skin Education' section dedicated to further educating the user on skincare topics
