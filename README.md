# Personal-Project

Introduction to my personal project for the Black Codher Bootcamp.

Glow station is an online skincare store which presents users with a range of prices when deciding which products to purchase.
The website also contains a quiz. The user will answer questions relevant to them, and at the end be presented with a personalised skincare routine based off their quiz answers.
The quiz will match the users answers with products / a full routine suited to them.

To run the project, in your terminal 

```
cd
```
into glowstation then 

```
npm start
```

Package informaton details about node package managers are detailed inside the glow station directory.
